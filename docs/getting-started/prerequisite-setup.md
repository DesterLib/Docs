## Storage Providers

Dester supports [Google Drive](#google-drive), [OneDrive](#onedrive), and [SharePoint](#sharepoint) as storage provider. Using them will require extra setup steps as outlined in their respective sections below.

You can ignore uneeded storage providers and only setup the storage providers you will use.

Dester also supports local storage, which requires no additional setup.

### Google Drive

1. Create a Google account if you don't have one already (who doesn't have a Google account ðŸ¤”)
2. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) dashboard
3. Create a new Google Cloud Console project
4. In the search bar, type `Google Drive API`. Find and click on the matching result in the list
5. Click `Enable this API`
6. On the sidebar on the left, find and click on `APIs & Services`
7. Click on `Credentials`
8. Click `Create Credentials` and select `OAuth Client ID`
